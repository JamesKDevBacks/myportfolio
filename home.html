          <p>Hello World! My name is James and this is my story. I grew up in Pittsburg, California. My life had some ups and downs, but everything came together when I met my Wife, Melissa. In the beginning, we had a tough time because there wasn't a lot going for me. I was stuck as a dead end job in retail and I would have to keep finding jobs to make ends meet. Without the support I had from my Wife, I don't think I would have been able to progress like I have now. I finally was able to give my family everything that I would have dreamed of when I was a kid. I worked as a Installation and Maintenence tech for the telephone company for over 13 years. On top of that, I am also enlisted in the US Army Reserves as a Signaleer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="a">
          <p>Now we have 3 beautiful and talented kids and nothing in the world means more than them. Recently, I have the time to actually start thinking about the path that I am on right now and where I am going. At the age of 38 years old, I started to realize that there are things in life that are more important and I would miss everything because of the long hours I would be gone everyday. I was never happy because I would miss my kids soccer games, dance competitions, TaeKwondDo events. Plus, my multiple deployments and times I would be away from home because of training. I love what I do, but missing my time away from my family is starting to hit me now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="b">
          <p>That is when I started to think to myself that I have to make a change. Start being proactive on making time for my family. Make the changes in my life so I can make it to those soccer games. Make it to the TaeKwonDo tournaments. Cheer for the one that is dancing on stage. Be home at a set time everyday so I wont hear, "When is Daddy going to be home from work?"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="c">
          <p>I always thought to myself that the only job that I can get has to be with my hands. Never liked to go to school because I never accomplished anything there. Got bad grades all the time. Now with my new determination to change, it is time now to go get what I always wanted. Time with my family. Now I am going back to school to get a degree in Computer Programming. I am taking online classes from UDEMY. Studying on my own and practicing on my own to become a Web Developer. Even taking it to the next step of learning functional programing language and back-end developing.</p>

        <div class="d">
          <p>Right now, I know my options are endless because I am grasping every subject and awarded the Deans list on my first semester back to school. Everything is possible. If you are reading this and you are in the same situation like me, where you feel you are stuck in that "rat race," I want to tell you that it is never too late. Go for what you want to do. Take that "leap of faith," and start making that list of what is needed for you to get closer to your goal. If you don't know where to start, come join me here. Join our community where we all can help eachother succeed.</p>
